To set up backend:
1. Navigate to /flask/
2. Install virtualenv by running `pip install virtualenv`
3. Run `virtualenv -p python3.8.13 virtual`. This will create your virtual environment.
4. Run `source virtual/bin/activate` (UNIX), or `virtual\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (Windows Powershell). This will put you inside the virtual environment. You know it works when it says `(virtual)` at the start of your command line.
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install all the python packages.
6. Test by running main.py from the /flask/gen/ directory (run `python gen/main.py`).
